    "Several of the FinTech companies that emerged over the last decade by unbundlding financial services now find themselves in the process of rebundling those same services as a diversification of their offerings. Companies such as Credit Karma, Robinhood, and PayPal among many others have branched off from their core core businesses to provide their users with several alternative banking solutions.\n",

    "Expansions of an application's feature set can often provide challenges in how to surface these features to users while maintaining discoverability and ease of navigation. Consolidating these features in a single mobile app seemed to be an interesting user experience thought experiment. Kakeibo aims to be an example of the end result of the re-bundling of financial services by becoming a one-stop-shop for personal finance.\n",

    "Based on the user research interviews, it seems that while personas could be define, it may be more effictive to think of users based on their most current financial goals. A user's financial goals dictate their current state of mind in regards to personal finance and is a large contributing factor when it comes to one's current personal finance needs. This can affect their behaviour when it comes to their personal finance and affect which of their personal finance applications they are paying the most attention to in a given moment. These financial goals can overlap and be reprioritized by the user. These may tend to follow a cycle, but each person's path is different through their financial journey.\n",
